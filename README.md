Goal: Place trains and extends train lines to keep the customers satisfied as long as possible! At the end of each week, you are granted a new train and a new train line. Toggle between active train lines, and the active train line can be modified via clicking and dragging the terminal ends or connectors between stations. From connectors, you can add multiple stations. From terminals, you can add multiple stations, and remove stations from the train line by dragging along the pertinent stations.

Disclaimer: It is quite buggy.
